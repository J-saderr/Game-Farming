## How To Play

The objective of BetterFarming is to cultivate a thriving farm, earn money through crop cultivation, and progressively upgrade your house through five levels. The ultimate goal is to reach the maximum house level before running out of energy or planting crops until midnight.

a. Planting Crops
- Players start with a small plot of land to cultivate crops. 
- Choose from a variety of crops to plant, each with its own growth cycle and selling price. 
- Use the money earned from selling crops to purchase new seeds and upgrade the farm.
  
b. Earning Money
- Successfully growing and harvesting crops yields money, which can be used for purchasing seeds, upgrading the house, and enhancing the farm.
- Experiment with different crops to optimise profits and progress in the game.
House Upgrades
- The player's house has five levels of upgrades. Each upgrade unlocks new features and benefits.
- Spend money to upgrade the house, improve energy levels, unlock new crops, and enhance overall farm efficiency.

c. Energy Management
- Players have a limited amount of energy each day.
- After a day of farming, players must return to their house to sleep; failure to do so will result in running out of energy and the game ending.
- Planting crops until midnight also leads to exhaustion and loss of the game.

d. Key Instruction:
- A, S, W, D: player's moves
- I: open the Inventory
- U (only when players approach houses): Update house levels
- L: Plant the crops
- H: Harvest the crops
- P: Pause the screen
